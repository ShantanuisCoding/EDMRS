# 🎵 Emotion Detection Music Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
This project is an AI-powered music recommendation system that detects user emotions through facial expressions and suggests suitable music accordingly. It leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques for emotion recognition and integrates a recommendation engine for personalized music suggestions.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎭 **Emotion Detection**: Uses AI to analyze facial expressions and classify emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.).
- 🎶 **Music Recommendation**: Recommends songs based on detected emotions.
- 📊 **Machine Learning Model**: Trained using datasets for accurate emotion classification.
- 📡 **Real-time Processing**: Works with live camera feeds for instant emotion recognition.
- 🎧 **Integration with Music API**: Fetches songs from a music database or streaming service.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js / Flask (for UI visualization)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask / FastAPI), TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV
- **Database**: MongoDB / Firebase (for user preferences and song storage)
- **AI Models**: CNN, Deep Learning (Emotion Recognition)
- **Music API**: Spotify API / YouTube API
